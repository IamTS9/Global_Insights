#Global Insights: Country Analysis and Cluster Visualization with K-means & Plotly
Overview:
This project delves deep into analyzing various country metrics to gain insights and draw patterns. By harnessing the power of the K-means Clustering algorithm, we've segmented countries into distinct groups, showcasing their similarities and differences. The visualization of these clusters is done interactively using the Plotly library, making data interpretation intuitive and visually appealing.

Key Features:
Data Analytics: Comprehensive analysis of country-specific metrics, which provides a foundation for further clustering.
K-means Clustering: Utilization of the algorithm to effectively segment countries based on shared attributes.
Interactive Visualization with Plotly: Dynamic plots that allow for a deeper dive into each cluster, enhancing understanding and interpretation of results.

Quick Start:
Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn, plotly, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib).
Data Input: Load your dataset of country metrics. Recommended format is CSV.
Run Analysis: Execute the main script to initiate data analytics.
Visualize: Post clustering, view the interactive visual representation using Plotly.


Feedback and Contributions:
Feel free to raise issues, suggest improvements, or contribute to the code. Your input is valued and appreciated.
